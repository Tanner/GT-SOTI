Georgia Tech's State of the Institute
=====================================
A visualization comparing a word's occurrence in Georgia Tech's State of the Institute for past years.

It was inspired by the New York Time's [The State of the Union in Words](http://www.nytimes.com/ref/washington/20070123_STATEOFUNION.html).

You can see the current stable version [here](http://tanner.github.io/GT-SOTI/). Note: It works better in Chrome due to the amount of DOM objects and JavaScript.

Created using [D3.js](http://d3js.org).
